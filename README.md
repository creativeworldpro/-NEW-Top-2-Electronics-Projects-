In this project, we are going to make simple electronics project that you can make at home easily. Using this project you can easily decorate your home office and other places also. It is very simple and cheap electronics project. There don’t have any risk factor to make this LED light project.


To make this led light project, and amplifier circuit we might need some electronics component. Those component list have to been given below.

Transistor Pinout - 

2SA 1494 –

It is a PNP transistor. As usual the transistor 2SA 11494 also contain 3 leg & this 3 leg’s also have 3 different names. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1no “Base”. 2no “Collector” & 3no “Emitter”

2SC 2922 - 

It is an NPN transistor. As usual the transistor 2SC 2922 also contain 3 leg & this 3 leg’s also have 3 different names. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1no “Base”. 2no “Collector” & 3no “Emitter”



Circuit Connection - 

To make this amplifier circuit, 1st we connect 150 KΩ resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with “Base” leg of 2SC2922 transistor and “Emitter” leg of 2SA1494 transistor. Then we connect Polyester Film Capacitor with the circuit. We connect with “Collector” leg of 2SA1494 transistor.

Now we connect 0.47 Ω resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with “Emitter” leg of 2SC2922 transistor and other terminal with the rest leg of Polyester Film Capacitor. Now we connect 2.2 Ω resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with “Collector” leg of 2SC2922 transistor and other terminal with “Base” leg of 2SA1494 transistor.

It is the time to connect 100 KΩ resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with the “Collector” leg of both Transistor. Again we connect 0.47 Ω resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with “Emitter” leg of 2SA1494 transistor.

Then we connect capacitor with the circuit. We connect capacitor positive leg with “Base” leg of 2SC2922 transistor.  Now we connect capacitor negative leg with sound control potentiometer. To input audio source, we need to connect audio input cable with the potentiometer.

For output sound, we connect speaker cable with ground leg and other cable with “Collector” leg of 2SA1494 transistor. For power source we’ll connect DC 12v with the circuit. We connect DC 12v positive cable with 0.47 Ω resistor and negative cable with ground leg of the circuit.

Our circuit in now completely ready for use. Now we just play music and enjoy the sound.
